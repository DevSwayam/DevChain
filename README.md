#Project DevChain

## Project Description :
A local blockchain system implemented in JavaScript and Node.js, designed to demonstrate the basic functionality of a blockchain.
### Problem Statement
A local blockchain system that allows for the recording and verification of transactions
The system should have the ability to mine new blocks and validate transactions through consensus algorithms
The system should be able to demonstrate the basic functionality of a blockchain through the console
### Idea/Solution
Create a local blockchain system using JavaScript that can simulate the basic functionality of a real blockchain
Implement a console interface that allows users to interact with the blockchain, such as viewing the blockchain, adding transactions, and mining new blocks
Implement consensus algorithms to validate transactions and mine new blocks
### Tech Stack Used
JavaScript
Node.js
### Features
Recording and verification of transactions
Mining of new blocks through consensus algorithms
Console interface for interacting with the blockchain
Display of current blockchain state
Validation of transactions
### Getting Started
Clone the repository
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DevSwayam/DevChain.git
Install the dependencies
Copy code
npm install
Start the blockchain
Copy code
node main.js
Interact with the blockchain through the console
### Example Use Case
Start the blockchain by running node main.js
The console will display the current state of the blockchain
Add a new transaction by typing addTransaction in the console and following the prompts
Mine a new block by typing mine in the console
The console will display the updated state of the blockchain, including the newly mined block and the added transaction
### Note
This project is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for use in a production environment.
Future Work
Implement advanced features such as smart contract, mining, and consensus algorithms
Integrate the blockchain with real-world applications
Explore other JavaScript libraries or frameworks to implement the blockchain
